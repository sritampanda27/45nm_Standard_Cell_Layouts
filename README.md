# Overview
This project involves the layout design of standard cells using the gpdk45nm process technology. The designs were verified for Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) using Cadence Layout Suite and Assura Verification Tool. The layouts were created with various multipliers (1X, 2X, 4X, and 8X) to analyze how performance and other parameters change with different multipliers.
# Project Objectives
- Design standard cell layouts in gpdk45nm technology.
- Verify DRC and LVS checks using Cadence Layout Suite and Assura.
- Analyze the impact of different multipliers (1X, 2X, 4X, 8X) on performance and other parameters.
# Tools Used
- Technology: gpdk45nm
- EDA Tools: Cadence Layout Suite, Assura
